# LLaMA 2

This repository provides an implementation of the LLaMA model architecture, inspired by Meta's LLaMA 2.

The code focuses on the model's structure and inference capabilities, incorporating features such as:

- **KV Caching**: Enhances inference efficiency by storing and reusing key-value pairs from previous computations.
- **Grouped Query Attention**: Optimizes attention mechanisms by grouping queries, leading to improved performance.
- **Rotary Embeddings**: Applies rotational position embeddings to capture positional information effectively.

Please note that this repository does not include training code. Training large language models like LLaMA is computationally intensive and typically requires substantial resources beyond a local setup. Therefore, the model weights are directly loaded from Meta's pre-trained models.

## Model Architecture

The LLaMA model is built upon the transformer architecture, featuring multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks. The incorporation of KV caching, grouped query attention, and rotary embeddings enhances its efficiency and performance during inference.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1: Zero-shot

**Input Prompt**:
```plaintext
Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms.
```

**Model Output**:
```plaintext
Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two or more particles become connected in such a way that their properties are correlated, regardless of the distance between them. This means that if something happens to one particle, it will instantly affect the other particle, regardless of how far apart they are.

Imagine you have two coins. If you flip one coin, the other coin will land on the same side, even if you flip it on the other side of the room. This is because the coins are not entangled, and the flip of one coin does not instantly affect the other coin.

Now imagine you have two particles that are entangled. If you flip one particle, the other particle will instantly flip to the opposite side, even if it's on the other side of the room. This is because the particles are connected in a way that allows their properties to be correlated, even at a distance.

Entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, the branch of physics that explains the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales.

### Example 2: One-shot

**Input Prompt**:
```plaintext
If Apple was founded in Japan instead of the US, it would have likely focused on:
```

**Model Output**:
```plaintext
Apple, founded in Japan, would have likely focused on creating innovative and user-friendly technology products that cater to the unique preferences and needs of the Japanese market. Here are some potential areas of focus:

1. Mobile payments: Japan is known for its cash-based society, and Apple, founded in Japan, would have likely prioritized mobile payment solutions to make transactions easier and more convenient for consumers.
2. Smart home technology: Japanese consumers are known for their love of smart home devices, and Apple would have likely developed a range of smart home products, such as smart thermostats, lighting systems, and security cameras.
3. Personalized health and wellness: Japan has a strong focus on health and wellness, and Apple, founded in Japan, would have likely developed products and services that cater to this market, such as wearable fitness trackers and health monitoring devices.
```

### Example 3: Few-shot

**Input Prompt**:
